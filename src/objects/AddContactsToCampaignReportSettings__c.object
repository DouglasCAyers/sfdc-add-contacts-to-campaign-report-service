    <description>Designed to match contact report id&apos;s to campaign id&apos;s. Used by apex report notification classes to automate adding contacts from a report to a campaign when the report runs. The &apos;Name&apos; of each custom setting record must be the 15 character ID of the saved contact report. The apex code looks up this campaign ID cross-reference based on the report it is subscribed to.</description>
